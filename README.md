# Neurodegenerative Disease Progression Model for Parkinson's Disease Analysis
Yuan Zhou

## Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) progression can be studied using DaTscans collected from living PD subjects, which reflect the density of dopamine transporters in the striatum of the brain, hence measure the availability of dopaminergic neurons left in the PD subjects.

The PPMI dataset provides 449 subjects that have DaTscans collected at baseline, year 1, 2, 4, and 5. Preprocessing the dataset leaves us with 365 subjects whose *striatal binding ratios* (SBR) are calculated for 4 regions: left caudate (LC), left putamen (LP), right putamen (RP), right caudate (RC). By applying a *mixture of linear dynamical systems* (MLDS) to this longitudinal dataset, we find 3 subtypes that correspond to different progression speeds.

#### Organization

The folder "mlds" contains the algorithm implementation of MLDS.  

The folder "utils" contains some utility functions.  

## Mixture of Linear Dynamical Systems

The MLDS models the exponential decay of signals in the DaTscans using a linear dynamical system (LDS) with *t*-distributed noise residues and a centrosymmetric transition matrix. Extending this LDS to K distinct transition matrices and noise variances, we can capture the subtypes inherent in the dataset.
