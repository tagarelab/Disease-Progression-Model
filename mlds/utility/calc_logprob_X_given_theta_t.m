function log_X_theta = calc_logprob_X_given_theta_t(X, ts, As, sigmas, nus, mus, Sigmas)
% Calculate logarithm of the time series with t-distributed noise residues
% given different cluster parameters
% Input:
%   X - cell array of N sequences of data, each with size D x Ti
%   ts - cell array of N sequences of time, each with size D x Ti
%   As - transition matrix of K clusters, size: D x D x K
%   sigmas - noise standard deviation for K clusters, size: 1 x K
%   nus - degree of freedom for K clusters, size: 1 x K
%   mus - mean of first data point for K clusters, size: K x D
%   Sigmas - covariance of first data point for K clusters, size: D x D x K
% Output:
%   log_X_theta - log of probability of each series for each cluster, size:
%                 N x K
